# GenerativeAI In NPC Game
The purpose of this project was to understand how Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) works in Non-Playing-Character (NPC) in Game works. In such way that the NPC understand users speech and response in regards to it.
Additionally, find ways to improve the existing pluggings used for speech-to-text for NPC or enhance new ways to improve the response and accuracy of these AI's.

* Personally, I used Unity Learning course about AI's and fouced on the BehaviourTree and from there will understand how to convert user speech and make the NPC reponds to it. The link to the Unity Learning is attached:
